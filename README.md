# AI_typing_trainer
USU CS5890 Final project

This program uses OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo. It requires the following dependencies:
- tkinter
- openai

You can install these using:
- "pip install tkinter"
- "pip install openai"

After installing dependencies, change the text in api_key.txt to your API key. If you need to get an OpenAI API key you can head to https://openai.com/blog/openai-api.

Run "python main.py" to start the program.

The theme of the window is determined by the OS, so if you are experiencing issues with the theme (white text over white background or black text over black background) change the "theme" variable on line 10 of main.py to either "light" or "dark".
